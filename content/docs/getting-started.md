## Before the start

Before start using the API, it's worthwhile knowing how we design it. This knowledge will improve your understanding of the SDK, ultimately enhancing your development efficiency.

To ensure clarity and consistency in our API design, we adhere to the following naming conventions:

1. **Camel Case**: We use camel case for all naming elements, capitalizing the first letter of each word (e.g., getProducts, updateCustomer).

2. **Descriptive Naming**: Abbreviations are generally avoided to enhance readability. We use full names for all elements except for well-established technical terms like API, URL, etc.
