OK, here is what we focus now.



We need to plan a schedule for the development. There are 4 groups of developers involved.

1. SDK developers

2. host app developers

3. backend developers

4. frontend developers



Before host app developers can integrate the SDK into Host app, backend developers and SDK develoeprs needs to make the data flow work at least. Then, frontend developers and backend developers work together to complete the admin tool website.



So, we need 2 milestone points:

1. SDK developer and backend developer. One provides a framework/dll, the other provides server and database. Estimated date is middle of April.

2. backend developer and frontend developer provide server, database and website. Estimated date is middle of May.



What do you think about the plan? Is the time enough for you? Or maybe you are on other projects too.
